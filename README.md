# to-do-list
A To-Do List is a simple application or tool that helps users keep track of tasks they need to complete. It typically allows users to:

Add new tasks with a title or description.

Mark tasks as complete once done.

Delete tasks they no longer need.

View all tasks in one place to organise their work or daily activities efficiently.

In web development projects, creating a to-do list helps practice HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (functionality), covering concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and data storage (localStorage for saving tasks).
